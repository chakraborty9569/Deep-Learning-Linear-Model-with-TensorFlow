# Deep Learning Linear Model with TensorFlow

This is a linear deep learning model develpoed using TensorFlow.

Tools Used:
1. Jupyter Note Book
2. Python 3
3. TensorFlow

This is developed with reference to the basic linear model which I developed earlier without TensorFlow. Refer to the code for the TensorFlow specific explaination. Otherwise the basic idea is the same.
